"""Library entry for scripts: the same guards as `getcheapapi call`, one call at a time.

call() prices on fresh prices, refuses past max_usd, pins AnyAPI to its cheapest source, and writes the ledger
line, so spend made from a script shows up in `getcheapapi spend`.

Stop is the base of what it raises: Refused means nothing was spent, NotServed means this call failed
without a charge and a batch may go on (Unavailable, a NotServed, says the source is down for now; wait=N
keeps trying it for N seconds); any other Stop (out of balance, served by an unexpected source) ends the batch.
